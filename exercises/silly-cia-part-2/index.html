          <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured
            hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
          <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible
            black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's
            inception in 1947.</p>
          <p>CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events,
            such as:</p>
          <ul class="article-featured-ul">
            <li>the Cold War</li>
            <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
            <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
          </ul>
